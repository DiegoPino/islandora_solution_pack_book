SUMMARY
-------

Book Solution Pack

This allows for the creation of book and page object (islandora:bookCModel,
islandora:pageCModel). Books are essentially a collection Pages, containing
only metadata and optionally a PDF file of the book. A Book's PDF can be
generated from each page. Pages are based on an uploaded tiff of the page.
From the uploaded TIFF its possible to generate images for use in the
"Islandora Internet Archive Bookreader". It is also possible to generate PDF
files per page. OCR and OCR coordinate data can also be generated from the
uploaded TIFF.

INSTALLATION
------------

Tesseract:

Tesseract is an OCR engine that was developed at HP Labs between 1985 and 1995
it is currently being developed at Google. Recognized as one of the most
accurate open source OCR engines available, Tesseract will read binary, grey, or
colour images and output text.

A TIFF reader that will read uncompressed TIFF images is also included.
Islandora Book Solution Pack currently uses Tesseract version 3.0, which can be
obtained from the project home page.

http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/

Installation will differ depending on your operating system; please see the
README Wiki for detailed instructions.

http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/wiki/ReadMe

Automatic page orientation detection was added in Tesseract 3.01.
For more information, see the Tesseract Project Home.

Gimp:

GIMP is the GNU Image Manipulation Program. It is a freely distributed piece of
software for such tasks as photo retouching, image composition and image
authoring. It works on many operating systems, in many languages.

Islandora Book Solution Pack currently uses Gimp version 2.6, which can be
obtained from the project home page.

TROUBLESHOOTING

F.A.Q.
------

Q: RAW_HOCR and ENCODED_OCR are not being generated and I'm getting the
   following error in the watchdog:

 tesseract failed to create hocr
  Error: 0
  Command: /usr/local/bin/tesseract /tmp/islandora:123473_OBJ.tiff /tmp/islandora:123473_OBJ.tiff.html -l eng hocr 2>&1
  Output: read_variables_file: Can't open hocr<br/>Tesseract Open Source OCR Engine with LibTiff

A: In versions of Tesseract prior to 3.01 the hocr config was not packaged with
   Tesseract. You must create the configuration yourself. Find the tessdata
   config directory, typically /usr/local/share/tessdata/config or
   /usr/share/tessdata/config. Goto to this directory and enter these commmands:

    touch hocr
    echo 'tessedit_create_hocr 1' > hocr
