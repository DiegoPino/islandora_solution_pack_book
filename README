SUMMARY

Book Solution Pack

This allows for the creation of book and page object (islandora:bookCModel,
islandora:pageCModel). Books are essentially a collection Pages, containing
only metadata and optionally a PDF file of the book. A Book's PDF can be
generated from each page. Pages are based on an uploaded tiff of the page.
From the uploaded TIFF its possible to generate images for use in the
"Islandora Internet Archive Bookreader". It is also possible to generate PDF
files per page. OCR and OCR coordinate data can also be generated from the
uploaded TIFF.
